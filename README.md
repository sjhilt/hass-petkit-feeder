# hass-petkit-feeder
This is a work in progress but wanted to get it out since I have it working

# SETUP
1) Follow the instructions to get the X-Session ID from the app found here: https://github.com/elfive/homebridge-petkit-feeder-mini
2) Change the `cookie` variable in `petkit-hass.py` 
3) Create a new folder on HASSIO in `/config` called `scripts`. If you want to place it somewhere else, go for it just change the command in the yaml
4) Edit your configuration Yaml with the data from `configuration.yaml` in this repo 
5) Restart HASSIO
